# SISR

Python file consists the code training ESRGAN for super image resolution task.
You need to change path according to your setup. Put your high resolution images in train/HR folder relative to python file.  You will get weights of your trained model and results for validation data after training. 
Here, I have trained the model on BreakHis Dataset. I have shown some results. BreakHis (Breast Cancer Histopathological) containes about 7000 images of breast tumor tissue containing benign and malignant samples. Data set divided into 70:10:20 for training, validation and testing.
Low resolution(LR) images are generated by downsampling HR images by a factor of 4 and adding some noises.

You can train on any dataset and convert low resolution images to high resolution images.
